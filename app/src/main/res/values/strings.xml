    Alcohol strength provided by the app is for regular strength based on my Bartesian Cocktail Maker machine.
    There is a big discrepancy between amounts advertised by Bartesian and measured by me, so take those with a grain of salt.
    It seems that at least 0.2oz of water is always added to each drink.
    Selecting \"strong\" on the machine will increase the amount of alcohol by 70%.
    Selecting \"light\" will reduce the amount by 30%.
    Selecting \"mocktail\" will add as much water as the light amount of alcohol."</string>
